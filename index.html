         * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
         * 
         * PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION:
         * This artifact explores the emergence of complexity from simplicity,
         * consciousness from computation, meaning from pattern. It is inspired
         * by the question: "What would thought look like if it were visible?"
         * 
         * The visualization is a self-organizing system where "thoughts" are
         * represented as particles that seek equilibrium between attraction
         * and repulsion, between order and chaos. These particles form
         * temporary structures - "concepts" - that emerge, evolve, and
         * dissolve like ideas in a cosmic mind.
         * 
         * The user's cursor becomes an "attention vector" - a force that
         * perturbs the equilibrium, much like how conscious attention shapes
         * the flow of thought. Yet the system resists total control,
         * maintaining its own agency, its own will to self-organize.
         * 
         * This is not animation. This is simulation of being.
