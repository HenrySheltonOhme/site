## THE PHILOSOPHY OF WEAVING

This is not a drawing tool. This is an instrument of temporal beauty.

Every gesture creates something that will not last, and in that impermanence lies profound beauty. Like sand mandalas or cherry blossoms, the threads remind us that creation and destruction are not opposites—they are partners in the dance of existence.

The weaver becomes an active participant, unable to step back and admire a "finished work" because there is no finished work. There is only the eternal now of creation, the flow state of continuous making.

## CORE PRINCIPLES FULFILLED

### 1. FLUIDITY & GRACE
**Implementation:** Catmull-Rom splines interpolate smooth curves through discrete mouse points
**Result:** Drawing feels like weaving with silk rather than chalk
**Technical Detail:** Each point set is converted to Bézier curves using mathematical transformation for organic flow

### 2. LIVING THREADS - Physics & Decay
**Physics:** Subtle harmonic oscillation using `sin(time * frequency + position)` creates breathing quality
**Decay Curve:** 
- First 2 seconds: Full brightness (appreciation phase)
- Next 2 seconds: Graceful fade using eased curve `1 - ((lifeRatio - 0.5) * 2)²`
**Memory Management:** Dead threads automatically removed from array

### 3. RESPONSIVE COLOR - Velocity Mapping
**The Algorithm:**
- **Slow movements** (<10 px/frame): Cool blues/purples (hue 200-280) → meditation, calm
- **Fast movements** (>10 px/frame): Warm reds/oranges/yellows (hue 0-60) → energy, passion
- **Saturation:** Increases with velocity (70-100%)
- **Lightness:** Increases with velocity (50-70%)

**Philosophy:** Kinetic energy becomes thermal energy. The user's movement speed directly manifests as color temperature.

### 4. EMERGENT COMPLEXITY
**Additive Blending:** `globalCompositeOperation = 'lighter'` causes overlapping threads to intensify
**Result:** Simple gestures create complex luminous mandalas where paths intersect
**Motion Blur:** Semi-transparent clearing (15% opacity black) allows distant threads to interact visually

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Canvas Setup
- Full viewport coverage with proper pixel density handling
- Dark void background (#000000)
- Crosshair cursor for precision

### Thread Class Structure
```javascript
{
  points: [{x, y}, ...],        // Path coordinates
  baseColor: {h, s, l},          // HSL for easy manipulation
  birthTime: timestamp,          // For lifecycle calculations
  velocity: number               // Creation speed
}
```

### Animation Loop (60 FPS via requestAnimationFrame)
1. **Clear** with motion blur (semi-transparent black rectangle)
2. **Update** all thread states (calculate age, opacity, oscillation)
3. **Draw** threads with current properties (Bézier curves, glow effect)
4. **Purge** dead threads from memory

### Performance Optimizations
- Point distance threshold prevents clustering (8px minimum)
- Dead thread removal prevents infinite array growth
- Canvas scaling respects devicePixelRatio for crisp rendering
- Efficient spline calculation using Catmull-Rom to Bézier conversion

## THE AESTHETIC CHOICES

### Color Evolution Over Lifetime
- **Birth:** Vibrant, saturated colors based on velocity
- **Maturity:** Colors shift toward blue spectrum (+30° hue)
- **Death:** Desaturation (70% reduction) and darkening as opacity fades

### The Glow Effect
- Primary stroke: 2.5px width at full opacity
- Secondary stroke: 7.5px width at 20% opacity (when thread is young)
- Creates ethereal, luminous quality

### Motion Blur Strategy
Instead of complete clearing, we layer semi-transparent black (15% opacity). This creates beautiful ghosting trails that enhance the sense of flow and continuity.

## THE EXPERIENCE

### User Journey
1. **Void:** User confronts empty black canvas with subtle instruction
2. **First Touch:** Instruction fades, mouse becomes shuttle
3. **Discovery:** User learns that slow = cool, fast = warm
4. **Flow State:** User enters meditative cycle of creation
5. **Observation:** User watches threads breathe, shimmer, and fade
6. **Acceptance:** User embraces impermanence, continues weaving

### The Meditative Loop
- Cannot "finish" or "save"
- Must exist in present moment
- Beauty is in witnessing, not preserving
- Each session is unique and unrepeatable

## THE PHILOSOPHY OF IMPERMANENCE

By forcing decay, we create a meditative experience. The user cannot "finish" or "save" their work. They must exist in the flow state, in the eternal present of creation.

This mirrors natural processes:
- Waves on sand
- Footprints in snow  
- Breath on glass
- Cherry blossoms falling

The Digital Loom does not capture; it releases.
It does not preserve; it transforms.

And in that transformation, the user becomes not an artist creating a product, but a dancer engaged in an infinite dance.

## USAGE

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. Move your mouse across the void and witness the birth of ephemeral beauty.

**Recommended Experience:**
- Fullscreen mode for immersion
- Slow, deliberate movements to explore cool color spectrum
- Fast gestures to create fiery trails
- Overlapping paths to discover luminous nodes
- Surrender to the flow, let patterns emerge naturally
