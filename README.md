# Digital Loom ðŸŒŒ

*An interactive canvas where ephemeral threads of light emerge from your gestures, live briefly, and gracefully fade into the void.*

## Quick Start

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser and move your mouse across the canvas.

## The Experience

- **Slow movements** create cool, meditative blues and purples
- **Fast gestures** create passionate reds, oranges, and yellows  
- **Overlapping paths** blend additively, creating glowing intersections
- **All threads** shimmer, breathe, and fade after ~4 seconds

## Philosophy

This is not a drawing toolâ€”it's an instrument of temporal beauty. You cannot save or preserve. You can only witness the eternal now of creation, embracing the beauty of impermanence.
